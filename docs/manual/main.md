# Introduction
## Description

This project provides a simple and thread-safe way of stopping runnable objects that are being executed in a separate thread or a thread-pool for C++11 projects. It is somewhat akin to the C++20 [`std::stop_token`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/stop_token.html) functionality.
