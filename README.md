# Stoppable

## Description

This project provides a simple and thread-safe way of stopping runnable objects that are being executed in a separate thread or a thread-pool for C++11 projects. It is somewhat akin to the C++20 [`std::stop_token`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/stop_token.html) functionality.

## Fresh setup

This project uses git submodules, please initialize them when creating a fresh repository clone. To initialize all of the submodule run the following command:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Documentation

If you want to have the latest documentation with your changes locally, you can generate it with [Doxygen](https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen) from sources by running the following:

```bash
doxygen Doxyfile
```

This will generate html like documentation at `[PROJECT_ROOT]/docs/html`. To use it open the `[PROJECT_ROOT]/docs/html/index.html` file with your browser.

## CMake Variant Integration

A CMake variant file is provided with this repository for easy cmake configuration setup. This functionality requires CMake Tools plugin to be installed. After Visual Code has been started Open Control Panel with Cntrl + Shift + P and type in CMake: Select Variant to start configuring your cmake project configuration.

## Building the project

To build the project [CMake](https://cmake.org/) project makefile generation as well as integrated testing and linting tools.

We recommend to create a directory for project makefiles and binaries:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
```

Once in this new **build** directory, generate the project makefiles for Debug configuration (you can change `Debug` for `Release` if debugging information is not needed):

```bash
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```

Once makefiles have been generated, build the project either in **Debug** configuration:

```bash
cmake --build . --target all --config Debug --
```

or **Release** configuration, if previous cmake configuration was set for **Release**:

```bash
cmake --build . --target all --config Release --
```

Once the project is built, it is also possible to use the integrated tests runner to run the provided tests:

```bash
ctest --verbose
```

## Creating local conan package

To create a custom local package first define `VERSION`, `USER` and `CHANEL` environmental variables. These variables will tell conan how to name the package.

- `VERSION` variable specifies package version number in the following format `${MAJOR}.${MINOR}.${PATCH}`. For more information see [Release versioning schema](CONTRIBUTING.md#release-versioning-schema)
- `USER` variable specifies the name of release community (for example `hahn-schickard`, `bincrafters`, etc.), it is used to showcase that this package is outside of [conan-center-index](https://conan.io/center/) repository
- `CHANEL` variable specifies the package type, i.e. if it is a stable, development or nightly release, defaults to empty

### Conan v1

To create local conan packages run the following command in project root directory:

```bash
conan create . ${VERSION}@${USER}/${CHANEL} --build=missing
```

### Conan v2

To create local conan packages run the following command in project root directory:

```bash
conan create . --version=${VERSION} --user=${USER} --channel=${CHANEL} --build=missing
```

In case you need to change default recipe options

```bash
conan create . --version=${VERSION} --user=${USER} --channel=${CHANEL} --build=missing -o ${OPTION_PAIR}
```
<<<<<<< HEAD

Where `${OPTION_PAIR}` is `option_name=value`. To add multiple options, continue to add `-o ${OPTION_PAIR}` as required.
